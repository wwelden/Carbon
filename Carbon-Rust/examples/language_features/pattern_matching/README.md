# Pattern Matching Examples

This directory contains examples demonstrating Carbon's pattern matching capabilities.

## Files

- `basic_match.cb` - Simple pattern matching with single patterns
- `multiline_match.cb` - Match expressions with multiple cases on separate lines
- `guard_patterns.cb` - Pattern matching with guard conditions (if clauses)
- `nested_guard_patterns.cb` - Nested tuple patterns combined with guards
- `wildcard_patterns.cb` - Using wildcard patterns (_) for partial matching

## Features Demonstrated

- Basic match expressions
- Guard patterns with `if` conditions
- Wildcard patterns for ignoring values
- Multi-case matching without commas
- Pattern matching with complex expressions

## Notes

These examples work with the current implementation. For nested tuple patterns with multiple similar cases, see the debugging directory for known limitations.
