# Carbon & Carbon-Oxide Programming Language

Carbon is a modern programming language that amalgamates syntax from Go, JavaScript, Rust, Haskell, C#, Java, and C. It features clean, expressive syntax with powerful functional programming capabilities including Haskell-inspired pattern matching and Go-style error handling.

This repository contains **two implementations** of the Carbon language:
- **Carbon** - The original implementation written in Haskell
- **Carbon-Oxide (Rust)** - A modern reimplementation written in Rust

## üìñ Project Origins

This started as a fork of British, an impractical programming language made for my programming languages course. Carbon was made with the goal of making British a language I would actually want to use by adding some of my favorite syntax elements from other languages such as Haskell, Rust, Go, Java, C#, C, Javascript, and some new ideas. Oxide is a refactor of Carbon in Rust with additional features. The goal of Oxide will be an efficient versatile language that will be fun to work with. At this current point I am not sure how far I want to go with this, but for now it is a fun summer project.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Carbon
```bash
cd Carbon
make
bin/carbon
```

### Oxide (Rust)
```bash
cd Oxide
cargo build
cargo run
```

Both implementations support the same Carbon language syntax with enhanced features:
```carbon
// Enhanced for loops (Go-style - no parentheses!)
> let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
> for num in numbers { print(num * 2); }
2
4
6

// While-style loops using 'for'
> let i = 0;
> for i < 3 { print(i); i = i + 1; }
0
1
2

// Function declarations with return types
> fn add(a: int, b: int) -> int { return a + b; }
> add(5, 3);
8

// Advanced pattern matching with guards and ranges
> match 25 {
    x if x > 50 => "large",
    18..30 => "young adult",
    _ => "other"
  };
"young adult"
```

## Language Features

Carbon combines the best features from multiple programming languages with modern enhancements:

### ‚úÖ Core Features

- **Multi-language Syntax Inspiration**:
  - **JavaScript**: `let`/`const` declarations, arrow functions (`x => x + 1`)
  - **Go**: For loops without parentheses, clean syntax (`for condition { }`)
  - **Rust**: Pattern matching syntax with guards and ranges
  - **Haskell**: Functional programming patterns, advanced pattern matching
  - **C/Java**: Familiar operators and expressions

- **Enhanced Data Types**:
  - Primitives: integers, floats, booleans, strings, null
  - Collections: arrays with pattern matching support
  - Tuples: multi-value expressions `(x, y, z)`
  - Custom classes with methods and fields

- **Advanced Control Flow**:
  - Go-style for loops: `for item in collection { }` and `for condition { }`
  - If expressions without parentheses: `if x > 0 { "positive" } else { "negative" }`
  - Pattern matching with guards: `match x { n if n > 10 => "big", _ => "small" }`

- **Function System**:
  - Arrow functions: `let f = x => x * 2`
  - Function declarations with type annotations: `fn add(a: int, b: int) -> int`
  - Curried functions and higher-order functions

- **Object-Oriented Programming**:
  - Class declarations with fields and methods
  - Constructor syntax with `new ClassName()`
  - Method calls and field access

- **Advanced Pattern Matching**:
  - Literal patterns: `42`, `"hello"`, `true`
  - Variable binding: `x`, `name`
  - Array destructuring: `[first, second, ...rest]`
  - Tuple patterns: `(x, y)`
  - Guard patterns: `x if x > 10`
  - Range patterns: `1..10`, `'a'..'z'`
  - Wildcard: `_`

- **Error Handling**: Go-style explicit error handling with `err()` and `isErr()`

### Example Code

```carbon
// Variables and type annotations
let x = 42;
const message = "Hello Carbon";
int y = 100;

// Enhanced for loops (corrected syntax)
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
for num in numbers {
    print(num * num);
}

// While-style loops using for
let counter = 0;
for counter < 10 {
    print(counter);
    counter = counter + 1;
}

// Function declarations with return types
fn factorial(n: int) -> int {
    if n <= 1 {
        return 1;
    } else {
        return n * factorial(n - 1);
    }
}

// Advanced pattern matching
fn describe_number(x: int) -> string {
    match x {
        0 => "zero",
        n if n < 0 => "negative",
        1..10 => "single digit",
        11..100 => "double digit",
        _ => "large number"
    }
}

// Class definitions
class Point {
    x;
    y;

    distance() {
        return Math.sqrt(this.x * this.x + this.y * this.y);
    }
}

let p = new Point(3, 4);
print(p.distance()); // 5

// Tuple destructuring
let coordinates = (10, 20);
match coordinates {
    (x, y) => print("Point at:", x, y)
}

// Error handling
fn safe_divide(a: int, b: int) -> int {
    if b == 0 {
        return err("Division by zero");
    }
    return a / b;
}

let result = safe_divide(10, 2);
if isErr(result) {
    print("Error occurred!");
} else {
    print("Result:", result);
}
```
