# Carbon


This started as a fork of British, an impractical programming language made for my programming languages course. Carbon was made with the goal of making British a language I would actually want to use by adding some of my favorite syntax elements from other languages such as Haskell, Rust, Go, Java, C#, C, Javascript, and some new ideas. Rusty Carbon is a refactor of Carbon in Rust with additional features. The goal of rust carbon will be an efficient versatile language that will be fun to work with. At this current point I am not sure how far I want to go with this, but for now it is a fun summer project.
